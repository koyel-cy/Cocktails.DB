    <p>Mixing the right amount of alcohol with the right amount of refresher to make it taste delicious is one thing – but making sure it tastes good without losing the zest of the alcohol is definitely something the Einstein’s of bartending cooked up very carefully.

While one may believe that making a drink being an easy task for the bartender, mixology requires genuine chemistry of components to feed out innovative and excellent cocktails. A good Mix is the behind the scenes of a good cocktail.

Mixology is generally accepted as a refined and in-depth study of the art and craft of mixing drinks. Think of it as the study of the chemistry of drinks, and the mixologist as the professional who studies that. A mixologist is just like a chef but for drinks and not for food.

The science of mixology mainly lies behind two major aspects – the blend of flavors and your glassware.
